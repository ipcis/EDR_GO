## Overview
This is a simple Go program that collects information about a client system and sends it to a server for monitoring and analysis. The client gathers data on processes, network connections, and host information, packages it as JSON, and sends it to a server using HTTP POST requests. The server component is responsible for receiving and processing the JSON data from multiple client systems.

This system can be used for basic system monitoring and can serve as a starting point for more advanced monitoring and analysis tools.

## Client Component
### Dependencies
- Go 1.16 or later
- `github.com/google/uuid` package
- `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/host` package
- `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/net` package
- `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/process` package

### How to Use
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Modify the `serverURL` variable in the `main` function to point to your server's endpoint for receiving JSON data.
3. Set the `interval` variable to the desired time interval for data collection and uploading.
4. Compile and run the Go program on the client system.
5. The client will start gathering data and sending it to the server at the specified interval.

## Data Collected
The client collects the following information:
- Hostname of the client system
- Universally unique identifier (UUID) of the client
- List of running processes, including process ID, name, executable path, MD5 checksum of the executable, and start time
- List of network connections, including local and remote IP addresses and connection status

## Security Considerations
- This code includes an example of skipping SSL certificate verification for simplicity. In a production environment, you should configure the client and server to use secure and valid SSL certificates.
- Be cautious with the data collected and ensure that it complies with privacy and security regulations.
